TikTok has made Home Depot’s 12-foot skeletons very trendy and the Poosh founder managed to snag two of the frequently sold-out lawn ornaments. The duo appeared to be more than 10 feet tall, extending well above the door, and the bone-y decor continued inside.</p><p>In addition to skeleton loungewear and pumpkins shaped into skeleton heads, the<a href=#> Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum also showed a glimpse of a dining room where a skeleton sat at a table covered in cobwebs and fake spiders. The black and white theme carried over into the mini pumpkins, candles and other decor.</p><p>Kardashian included photos from her spooky season celebrations that took her outside of her home too. She posted a snap of The Spadena House, also known as The Witch’s House, a storybook home in Beverly Hills that looks like something out of The Nightmare Before Christmas, as well as jack-o-lantern cotton candy.</p><p>Jenner, 24, meanwhile, is keeping her decor a little brighter for daughter Stormi, 3. The Kylie Cosmetics founder showed off a bowl full of orange mini pumpkins, a fuzzy decorative spider and an <a href=#>Amazon Handmade candle</a> in the scent “Hello Fall” from Sweet Water Decor.</p><p>She even brought <a href=#>some Halloween spirit</a> to the kitchen, sharing a couple photos of seasonal cupcakes, decorated with eyeball sprinkles and candy corn. While the first photo of baked goods clearly had the touch of a seasoned baker,<a href=#> Stormi also got have some fun</a>, making a mess while icing her own cupcakes.</p><p>Jenner’s daughter, who she shares with rapper <a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>, is a big fan of October 31. “Stormi loves Halloween,” Jenner told <a href=#><strong>James Charles</strong> </a>during a 2020 Halloween makeup tutorial. “She’s been talking about it for the last two months. She was so excited.”</p><p>Jenner, who is <a href=#>expecting her second child</a> with Scott, and Kardashian, who shares Mason, 11, Penelope, 9, and Reign, 6, with ex <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>, got together with their other siblings for the holiday last year. They did a <a href=#>private family party with their nieces and nephews</a> to allow the children to celebrate together since normal gatherings were called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Since Halloween is ‘canceled,’ we can’t trick or treat or anything. We — me and [my sister] <a href=#><strong>Kim [Kardashian]</strong></a> — decided to do something really special at her house,” Jenner told the makeup guru. “We’re gonna have all the cousins over and I think we’re gonna do, like, fake little houses in our backyard so they can, like, trick or treat.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Kourtney and Kylie’s Halloween decorations:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuLDB0a2lnrFdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmKur7CMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6pZpmimnqzscCdsGaen6d6qa3LpaawnZWjerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kartiki-gaikwad-wiki-age-husband-boyfriend-biography-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>KartikiGaikwadWiki, Age, Husband, Boyfriend, Biography, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
