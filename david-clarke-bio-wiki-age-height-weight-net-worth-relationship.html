He has been embroiled in controversy over his MA thesis, as it was claimed that the law enforcer plagiarized it. This, however, did not deter his brave spirit from continuing to defend his prestige. On September 1, 2017, the Sheriff issued a heartfelt statement declaring that, after 40 years of service, he was finally ready to retire.</p><h2>David Clarke Relationship And Affairs</h2><p>Julie Clarke was David’s wife; they married in 1996, and she was very supportive of her husband, always accompanying him to public events. She was raised in Wisconsin as well and attended Ashwaubenon High School before enrolling at the University of Wisconsin to pursue a degree. Julie, as previously stated, works as a realtor in Milwaukee, a job she has held for many years – the couple met in court, where Julie was working as a clerk while David was there for a case as a lead detective. The couple has no children, and David filed for divorce from his wife in early 2018, effectively ending their marriage.</p><h2>David Clarke Net Worth 2023</h2><p>The former law enforcement officer eventually earned $132,000 per year as a Sheriff, plus an additional $220,000 from speaking engagements.
