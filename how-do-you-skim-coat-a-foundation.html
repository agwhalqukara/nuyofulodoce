Use the flat side of the trowel to smooth the cement onto the wall once it has been spread on the wall. Extra cement may be scraped away with the edge of the trowel in a circular motion. Apply a thick enough application of cement to completely cover the surface with an even layer of the material. Allow 24 hours for the skim-coat to dry completely before painting."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Extra cement may be scraped away with the edge of the trowel in a circular motion. Apply a thick enough application of cement to completely cover the surface with an even layer of the material. Allow 24 hours for the skim-coat to dry completely before painting.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to skim coat concrete in this situation?</h3><p>Skim coating concrete is the process of putting two coats of finish to a concrete surface. 1/8 inch thick should be the thickness of the first layer, which is Thin Finish. Using a hose, spray the driveway to ensure that the finish forms a solid connection with the concrete surface.
