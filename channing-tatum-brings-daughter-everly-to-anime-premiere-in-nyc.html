Everly was all smiles while posing alongside mascot versions of the characters Tanjiro and Nezuko Kamado on the red carpet.</p><p>Tatum, 43, got in the anime spirit by rocking a green and black hoodie resembling Tanjiro’s costume. His daughter sported a replica of the character Shinobu Kocho’s outfit, complete with a black and purple wig and Shinobu’s signature butterfly hair clip.</p><p>While Everly hasn’t made many public appearances with her dad, fans previously got a glimpse of the duo’s bond when they attended <a href=#>The Eras Tour</a> in August 2023. The Magic Mike star <a href=#>donned a T-shirt</a> with the lyrics “It’s me, hi, I’m the dad, it’s me” in reference to <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>’s song “Anti-Hero.” One month later, he shared <a href=#>several sweet Polaroid pics</a> of Everly via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Tatum welcomed his daughter with <strong>Jenna Dewan</strong> in May 2013. Five years later, the Step Up costars <a href=#>announced their split</a>, writing in a joint statement that they would continue to be “dedicated parents to Everly.”</p><p>Tatum, who is currently <a href=#>engaged</a> to actress <strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong>, has been candid about his fatherhood journey over the years. In February 2022, he told <a href=# rel=noopener>VMan</a> magazine that <a href=#>he was “afraid”</a> of parenting on his own following his divorce.</p><p>“I know that I liked to act and play make-believe and magical things, but I just didn’t know if I was going to be able to meet her on her level,” he told the outlet. “Especially [when I became] a single dad. I was doubly afraid. Was I going to be able to do any of the stuff that a mother should do? That a mother, as a woman, can relate to her as?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Channing-Tatum-Hits-the-Red-Carpet-With-10-Year-Old-Daughter-Everly-at-Anime-Film-Premiere-1.jpg><p>He went on to note that the key to his relationship with his child was to “go into her world and do whatever that is that [Everly] wanted [me to do].”</p><p>While coparenting their daughter, <a href=#>Tatum and Dewan reunited</a> at one of Everly’s dance competitions in May 2023 along with Dewan’s mom and fiancé <strong>Steve Kazee</strong>.</p><p>“Channing has nothing but the utmost respect for Jenna,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> Weekly that same month. “He will always hold her in the highest regard as the mother of their child and nothing could ever change that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dewan and Kazee, who have <a href=#>been together</a> since 2018, are currently <a href=#>expecting their second baby</a> after <a href=#>welcoming son Callum</a> in March 2020.</p><p>Last month, Dewan told <a href=# rel=noopener>Romper</a> that her coparenting relationship with Tatum is a <a href=#>“journey” that “never ends,”</a> adding, “You just learn as you go and get better at certain things, and for me, Evie will always be my top priority. I just continually put her first. That’s how I can manage all hard things.”</p><p>Dewan said that her daughter has “gotten into a flow with” adjusting to life after her parents’ “tough” split and “loves [her brother] Callum.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGju6q6xmarmqylonqjvsinnqxllJbCqLTTnqlmnaaav63FjK2mZpmenrqmec%2BrnKahlaeybrXNZqWym18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carrie-underwood-children-meet-carrie-underwood-s-sons-isaiah-michael-fisher-and-jacob-bryan-fish.html><span>←</span><span>Carrie Underwood Children: Meet Carrie Underwoods Sons Isaiah Michael Fisher And Jacob Bryan Fish</span></a>
