In 2009, Tillman was awarded the Ed Block Courage Award and, three years later, became the recipient of the Salute to Service Award.</p><p>He is a three-time honoree with the <a href=# title="Brian Piccolo Net Worth">Brian Piccolo</a> Award and in 2013, earned the <a href=# title="Walter Payton Net Worth">Walter Payton</a> NFL Man of the Year honor.
