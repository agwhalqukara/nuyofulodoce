He then spent <strong>$6 million</strong> on various upgrades that included adding a helicopter pad, infinity pool and a private movie theater.</p><p></p><p>50's lawyers confirmed yesterday that the mansion costs roughly <strong>$72,000 per month</strong> to maintain and finance. He spends $5000 per month on gardening, $18,000 on utilities and $13,000 on insurance for the massive estate.</p><p>50 attempted to sell the house in 2007, at the peak of the housing bubble, for $18.5 million. No buyers bit. Then the bubble burst at the end of 2008. 50 attempted to sell the house several times over the last few years with no luck. Today the property is valued at around $8 million.</p><p><a href=# title="50 Cent Net Worth">50 Cent's</a> financial woes relate back to the fact that as of this writing, he technically owes over $30 million to various creditors. The largest debts are $18.4 million to a headphone company called Sleek Audio and $7 million to a <a href=# title="Rick Ross Net Worth">Rick Ross</a>' former girlfriend who appeared in a sex tape that 50 leaked to the public. In a recent court filing, 50 claimed he controlled just $15 million worth of assets, made up mostly of cash and stock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJobGllk5q7tXnAoKmenaNiwbB50Z5kpaGjqXqku82nnJysmZjCtXnMmqWsoZ%2BjeqK%2FjKmYq6xdpLNursCnoqutoKmwunnFoqOippdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-famous-canadian-singer-grimes-dating-what-is-her-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the Famous Canadian Singer, Grimes Dating?
