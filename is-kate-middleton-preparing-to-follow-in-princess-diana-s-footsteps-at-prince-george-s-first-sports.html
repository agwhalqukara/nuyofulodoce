But as a very hands-on mum, there's no doubt that Kate will be there to cheer her son in as he participates in his first ever sports day this month.</p><p id=eDPH7qI3DkEI><a class=hm-link href=#>In pictures: Kate's best sporting moments</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eU4ay3qYsfak data-wc=8><strong>Princess Diana - her life as a mother</strong></p><p id=emeWW2ofmUCx data-wc=107>Students at St Thomas's do not compete for personal glory - pupils in the lower school take part in a number of fun and enjoyable races such as the sack race, the egg and spoon race and the obstacle course in order to win points for their individual houses. But while house victory is celebrated, rather than personal success, there can be no doubt that winning or coming second or third in any of the races would be important to all little reception-aged children like George, and his cousin Maud, daughter of Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor, who is also in the same year at the school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4d1f99ffdd2-princess-diana-sports-day-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eIDBhr6jW3St data-wc=16><strong>Princess Diana running towards the finishing tape in the Mothers' Race at Wetherby School in 1991</strong></p><p id=eMUAM53q2T_t data-wc=64>Parents turn out in force for such events on the Thomas' school calendar, for a morning of fun and hearty applause, with members of the PTA offering strawberries and coffee at the event. Whether Kate (or indeed Prince William) will opt to partake in any parents' races remains to be seen, but we know from <a class=hm-link href=#>previous sporty engagements</a> with her husband, that the Duchess is definitely competitive!</p><p id=e_5Y6Fe306Nl><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY: Most memorable royal family moments from Royal Ascot</a></p><p id=eMzIq5Ewuix5 data-wc=66>Of course Princess Diana's sports mothers' race moment went down in history. The late royal looked delighted in 1989 when she came first in the mothers' race at Wetherby School where Prince William was a pupil. The glee she showed as she powered across the finish line ahead of all the other mums at anual pre-prep sports day held at Richmond Rugby Club is now legendary.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
