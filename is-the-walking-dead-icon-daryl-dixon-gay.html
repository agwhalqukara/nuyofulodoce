<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Is The Walking Dead icon Daryl Dixon gay?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=501 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Ever since AMC’s original zombie-esque extravaganza <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead</a></strong> initially premiered on cable back in 2010 and eventually became one of the most popular television series of all time, life-long fans have analyzed and wondered about a variety of different characters — all of which are either seen as lighthearted good guys or pure baddies. Not only that, but eagle-eyed viewers have simultaneously paid close attention to certain behaviors and mannerisms each individual character possesses.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>That being said, it would be a complete understatement to say that fan-favorite<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daryl Dixon</a></strong> (Norman Reedus) has been the hottest figure placed under the microscope in terms of getting to know more about the show’s characters. As a result, many viewers have scratched their heads for years and wondered if Daryl is gay — despite a strong majority of the fanbase suggesting that Daryl and Carol (Melissa McBride) should become an item.</p><h2 id=h-is-daryl-dixon-gay data-injectable=false>Is Daryl Dixon gay?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-walking-dead-daryl-dixon-promo-image-1-e1689614144713.jpg><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>Although some folks have felt convinced of Daryl’s sexuality for a while now, it only took a few comments from TWD creator Robert Kirkman to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clear up the rumors</a> once and for all. In a 2014 interview with ABC, Kirkman confirmed that Dixon is “actually straight,” although he recently expressed that he wouldn’t be opposed to changing up Daryl’s developmental arc <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in his new spin-off series</a>, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. In fact, Kirkman detailed that the original plans were for Dixon to be gay, but it simply never happened.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>On that same note, Reedus simultaneously expressed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he “isn’t afraid”</a> to portray Daryl as a gay character and that he would happily work with whatever material the writers gave him. So while Dixon isn’t currently gay canonically, that doesn’t mean that plans won’t soon change down the line as the character’s story continues to expand in the latest pulse-pounding series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn55lp5a5rLXNoGSdnZGZeqqvzqdknZmirrlusMixpqdll5bGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrew-castle-and-daughter-georgina-open-up-about-their-close-relationship-and-why-this-christmas-wi.html><span>←</span><span>Andrew Castle and daughter Georgina open up about their close relationship and why this Christmas wi</span></a>
