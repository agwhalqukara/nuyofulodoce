He later relocated to South Norwalk with his two sisters, Abby and Jill, and his mother, Robin. There is no information available regarding his father.</p><p class=align-left>After graduating from their local high school, this entertainer attended Fordham University but dropped out to pursue his career.</p><p class=align-left>He has a passion for all things canine and owns three pooches named Finney, Henry and Brannie, who regularly appear in his videos.</p><h3>How did Mike Majlak make his money?</h3><p class=align-left>This social media icon started his career at <i>Nice Guy Promotions, </i>where he was responsible for online advertising. He proceeded to blog for <i>Essential Foodie</i> and then moved up to the marketing managerial position for<i> Foodsac</i> and then the managing director at <i>Maverick.</i></p><p class=align-left>How did mike <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Majlak</a> become famous? He was fortunate enough to meet the boxer and social media icon Logan Paul, and the two joined forces on the<i> </i>the<i> YouTube </i>channel <i>Impaulsive</i>. Majlak quickly became a popular host and continues to work on the podcasts alongside the actor and <i>YouTube</i> sensation George Janko.</p><p class=align-left>The entertainer started his <i>YouTube </i>channel,<i> Mike Majlak Vlogs</i>, in 2010, but it was not until late 2017 that he uploaded his first clip. The majority of the content on his channel are video blogs.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to all his efforts in the social media industry, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike Majlak's</a> net worth in 2021 amounts to an estimated $1.5 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5031748c442fa116.jpg><h3>Relationship troubles</h3><p class=align-left>This <i>YouTube </i>sensation started dating the pornographic film star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lana Rhoades </a>in mid-January 2020. Their relationship has not been very stable, as the couple separated in October 2020, supposedly because they two want different things in life. However, a few days later, the couple reunited, and things looked hopeful moving forward.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, another separation occurred on 18 February 2021 when the adult film star shared an<i> Instagram </i>post with the caption:</p>"The reason Mike is not on my Instagram is because we are not together, I am single. We are broken up and not getting back together this time. Now leave me alone about it."<p class=align-left>The cause for their most recent split is apparently due to issues of loyalty, as Mike was busted flirting with another woman. Whilst playing the online racing game <i>GTA</i>, the <i>YouTuber</i> openly chatted up a female player, even going so far as to ask for her <i>Instagram</i> handle in an attempt to take things further.</p><p class=align-left>In an episode of <i>Impaulsive</i>, Mike describes how Lana lost her cool and was totally unimpressed by his actions.</p><p class=align-left>Their relationship is officially over, but Mike Majlak's ex-girlfriend announced that she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eight weeks pregnant</a> on 2 June 2021, although according to the <i>YouTuber, </i>he is not the father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4d863745b8f69d6a.jpg><h3>Are Logan Paul and Mike Majlak still friends?</h3><p class=align-left>Since last year, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mike Majlak and Logan Paul </a>have been out of sorts, and the issue was sparked by <a href=#>Harry Styles'</a> controversial <i>Vogue </i>cover in the November 2020 issue, modelling a white dress for the magazine.</p><p class=align-left>Logan Paul spoke about the matter and defended Styles in episode 235 of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> <i>Impaulsive. </i></a>When it was stated that we need to "<i>bring back manly men,</i>" he responded by hosting "<i>a masterclass in addressing toxic masculinity</i>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/fd5cce34c68d15a8.png><p class=align-left>Majlak, on the other hand, called his friend out, claiming that <a href=#>Paul </a>only made a stand as a publicity stunt. But, again, this was seen as a lapse of loyalty, as he publicly accused the boxer of being two-faced.</p><p class=align-left>The social media icon was also accused of live-streaming a conversation with Logan on his <i>Twitch </i>channel, stating that Logan used the <i>"r-word"</i> during the chat with the <i>YouTuber</i><a href=#>David Dobrik. </a>No evidence of this phrase appeared in the clip. <a href=#>Logan Paul </a>was utterly unaware that the call was being streamed, and the video has since been removed from his <i>Twitch</i> channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8df7a30da815bd41.png><p class=align-left>Mike Majlak is a uniquely talented individual. His <a href=#>celebrity</a> interviews on the Impaulsive podcast are intriguing, making him a well-known and prominent host on the channel. However, that mouth of his seems to get him into quite a bit of trouble, causing scandals wherever he goes.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Lana Rhoades' net worth, salary, height, partner, real name, profile</a></p><p class=align-left>Lana Rhoades, an adult film star from the United States, is one of <i><a href=#>Pornhub's </a></i>most popular content creators.
