Be it the graduation information or the institute this slim bodied lady attended, alas, there is nothing accurately known.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Thinking of being a model and working day and night to make things happen are two different things. Hosk was more interested in sports from an early age and had sights of featuring in the basketball team, but modeling took center stage in the end.</p><p>Hosk is a talented model, and she was ranked 15th in the Top Sexiest List.

Surprisingly this is not the only relationship status of the lady. Earlier she was in a relationship with <strong>Chad Faust</strong>.
