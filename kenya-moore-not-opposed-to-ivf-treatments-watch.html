The reality star spoke to <i>Us Weekly</i> about their future plans. Watch the video above!</p><p>On November 16, the couple were <a href=#>spotted kissing</a> in Barbados after it was reported that she is undergoing IVF treatment. According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the 46-year-old was staying on the island for a few weeks while undergoing fertility treatments.</p><p>“Let’s just say that we definitely want to have a child. I’m not opposed to treatments, so I wouldn’t be ashamed of that,” Moore told <i>Us </i>when asked about her visit to Barbados. “Let’s just hope in the next year we will see some results from whatever I’m doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kenya-moore.jpg><p>In a deleted <a href=#>Instagram post</a> of her dogs on November 16, the Bravo star asked fans for prayers as she wrote, “My twins #kingsandtwirl&nbsp;they bring so much fulfillment in my life, calm, happiness and purpose. I can only imagine what children do. Pray for me.”</p><p>It appears that Moore’s dogs have given her some mom-to-be practice. “Everyone tells me I will be an amazing mom because I’m very nurturing and I’m very patient,” she said. “Look how I am with my little puppies. I treat them like they will break. I spoil my little puppy babies. Everyone says I will be a great mom and I’m hoping I will be too.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, it seems like there won’t just be a baby in her future, if it’s up to Daly, there will be a minivan as well.</p><p>“He wants to be the kind of father that is really involved,” Moore told <i>Us</i>. “He dreams of driving a minivan. I’m like, who dreams of driving a minivan? He’s so excited. I think it’s cute. The minivan or a Ferrari? Minivan might attract housewives, real housewives, and a Ferrari might attract the wrong type of women who might think he’s single.”</p><p>Moore surprised fans when she secretly wed Daly in St. Lucia in June. “I married the love of my life and the best man I’ve ever known,” she told <a href=#><i>Us Weekly </i></a>in a statement&nbsp;at the time. “I never believed I could be this happy! I want to thank everyone who made my day special. I felt so beautiful in my Pallas Couture dress! It was a magical day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZ6urm65zqipnmWepMFuu8%2BppqydlGLBsHnIr51mrKKarrW5xKerrGWnlsGktI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./january-29-famous-birthdays-all-famous-birthdays.html><span>←</span><span>January 29 Famous Birthdays - All Famous Birthdays</span></a>
