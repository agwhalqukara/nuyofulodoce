Fans got to see a lot of her finishing move because she was rarely defeated, and people didn't have a problem with that as it looked impactful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeing her power up her opponent and lift them into the air is a fantastic feat of strength that few wrestlers in the women's division can match. That alone makes the move fantastic, but seeing her then slam them down face-first to the mat is a devastating way to wrap it up.</p><h2 id=jon-moxley-39-s-paradigm-shift-is-simple-but-effective><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jon Moxley's Paradigm Shift Is Simple But Effective</span></h2><h3 id=he-39-s-bringing-respect-back-to-the-ddt>He's Bringing Respect Back To The DDT</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>AEW Tenure</p></th><th scope=col><p>AEW Titles</p></th><th scope=col><p>Major Matches</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>May 25, 2019 - Present</p></td><td><ul><li>3x AEW World Champion</li><li>1x Interim AEW World Champion</li><li>1x AEW International Champion</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Vs.

This is <a href=#>an impaler DDT</a>, with Moxley adding in the decision to lift his opponent high into the air before driving them down headfirst into the mat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/jon-moxley-s-definitive-10-best-aew-matches-ranked-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jon Moxley's Definitive 10 Best AEW Matches, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jon Moxley is the heart and soul of AEW, having put on some incredible matches for the promotion.</span><p>The fans will always react massively when this move connects because of the impact that it makes, and that is ultimately what a finishing move is all about.</p><h2 id=ftr-39-s-shatter-machine-always-gets-a-pop><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>FTR's Shatter Machine Always Gets A Pop</span></h2><h3 id=this-has-also-been-known-as-the-big-rig>This Has Also Been Known As The Big Rig</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>AEW Tenure</p></th><th scope=col><p>AEW Titles</p></th><th scope=col><p>Major Matches</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>May 27, 2020 - Present</p></td><td><p>2x AEW World Tag Team Champions</p></td><td><ul><li>Vs.

However, something that people can always rely on is an excellent finish, as their Shatter Machine double-team move is a brilliant one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The move is one that they can hit in a transition out of nowhere which makes it unpredictable. One of the two will throw their opponent up in the air, with the other catching them with a Codebreaker of sorts, while the other wrestler slams them down for added impact to help this look fantastic.</p><h2 id=brian-cage-39-s-drill-claw-plants-his-opponents-with-authority><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Brian Cage's Drill Claw Plants His Opponents With Authority</span></h2><h3 id=his-physique-helps-enhance-this-move>His Physique Helps Enhance This Move</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/brian-cage-drill-claw-cropped.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>AEW Tenure</p></th><th scope=col><p>AEW Titles</p></th><th scope=col><p>Major Matches</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>January 12, 2020 - Present</p></td><td><p>1x FTW Champion</p></td><td><ul><li>Vs.

That includes his finisher, the Drill Claw. This one is a true showcase of power, with Cage lifting his opponents with ease before planting them down to the mat with authority.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He doesn't land them onto their heads, which is a good thing for safety.

However, there is no escaping from the fact that his Black Arrow is one of the best finishers in the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Few people can put together the aerial quality that PAC does, as he gets huge height and several rotations on this one.

He brings a lot of excellent moves such as his Spear, which is one of the best in the business. However, it is his finisher that truly captures the attention of audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Roshambo is a brilliant move as it showcased his strength, lifting up his opponent onto his shoulder before dropping them down face-first onto the mat, finishing it off with a big impact.</p><h2 id=el-hijo-del-vikingo-39-s-630-senton-wows-people><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>El Hijo Del Vikingo's 630 Senton Wows People</span></h2><h3 id=he-gets-sever-rotations-in-a-tight-space>He Gets Sever Rotations In A Tight Space</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/el-hijo-del-vikingo-63-senton-cropped.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>AEW Tenure</p></th><th scope=col><p>AEW Titles</p></th><th scope=col><p>Major Matches</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>March 22, 2023 - Present</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><ul><li>Vs.

He can bust out tons of aerial moves, but it is his 630 Senton that truly gets people excited.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike most people who put their opponents further out, Vikingo puts a lot of his close to the corner which makes it even more impressive.

His finisher is the same one that he had during his time with WWE, which is essentially a running double knee strike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/10-most-underrated-wcw-finishers-ever-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Most Underrated WCW Finishers Ever</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>These great WCW finishers don't get enough love from wrestling fans!</span><p>Danielson normally builds the move up with audience interaction, and he gets a lot of pace on his run before delivering the blow which is what sets it apart from everything else on the roster.</p><h2 id=athena-stuns-her-enemies-with-the-o-face><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Athena Stuns Her Enemies With The O-Face</span></h2><h3 id=this-takes-the-stunner-to-new-heights>This Takes The Stunner To New Heights</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>AEW Tenure</p></th><th scope=col><p>AEW Titles</p></th><th scope=col><p>Major Matches</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>May 29, 2022 - Present</p></td><td><p>ROH Women's Champion</p></td><td><ul><li>Vs.
