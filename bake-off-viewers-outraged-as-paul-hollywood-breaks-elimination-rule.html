Paul was saw telling fellow judge <a class=hm-link href=#>Prue Leith</a> and hosts <a class=hm-link href=#>Noel Fielding</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Sandi Toksvig</a> that the competition was so close that they needed to consider bakes produced on previous weeks while making their decision – something he has said he will never do. He then sent home Stacey, a decision which caused yet more controversy with fans, who pointed out that being named star baker just seven days ago was surely a good reason to keep her in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a0668a0ad6cd-bake-off-judging-z.jpg><p id=eYrSkgTjs-Uw data-wc=13><strong>Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig</strong></p><p id=e725nDQEEq82 data-wc=101>Stacey didn't have an easy weekend in the tent, but seemed to be in with a chance when Steven Carter-Bailey's show-stopping meringue started to melt and collapse before it got to the judging table. Viewers were torn over who should go, before Paul admitted that he and Prue had taken into consideration bakes from the whole series. "Initially we have to have a look at this weekend and if that still has not drawn any obvious answer, it is so close, then yes you look back retrospectively on the while series. It has only happened a couple of times,"&nbsp;he said.</p><p id=e1EGdm-zrp3i data-wc=10><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY:&nbsp;Sandi Toksvig makes shocking Great British Bake Off revelation</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9fb42bd35dc8-bake-off-stacey-z.jpg><p id=egQ49oBHssO8 data-wc=11><strong>Stacey Hart became the ninth contestant to leave the baking competition</strong></p><p id=eUz5CotL1C-f data-wc=94>Viewers quickly took to Twitter to discuss the decision, with one writing: "Paul, if you look back on the weeks of this year's bake off then all you will see is how wrong you were in your previous decisions."&nbsp;Another wrote: "I agree Steven should be in the final, but changing the rules to keep him in because he had a bad week isn't right."&nbsp;A third lamented the <a class=hm-link href=#>loss of former contestant Liam</a>, who was eliminated last week: "Why didn't they judge previous weeks last week & save Liam? #fix #gbbo… Steven deserved to go this week!"</p><p id=eA_tiFHbOfYp data-wc=10><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY:&nbsp;American celebrities who love the Great British Bake Off</a></p><p id=eFDxuQGkqsZV data-wc=55>Speaking about her time in the competition, 42-year-old Stacey said: "So close.
